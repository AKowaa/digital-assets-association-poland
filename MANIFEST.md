# Manifest

Everybody „investing“ into digital assets should read: 
1) brave new world 

2) 1984 

3) a cypherpunk manifesto 

4) open source everything manifesto 

5) no place to hide and watch the documentaries 

6) the internets own boy 

7) deep web to get at least a tiny little clue of what this is all about.

Our societies are at a tipping point. Mind Manipulation and global scale surveillance are omnipresent. Only some few people seem to care. For the first time in history we have access to the weapons allowing for digital self defense in the form of privacy preserving communication (matrix, protonmail, later orchid protocol), transactions (zcash, monero) and business flows (ethereum with snarks, keep.network) - let’s use them.

Crypto might be our only way out of this misery, so let’s not screw this up. The bigger the speculative bubble, the bigger the crash, the longer a potential „crypto winter“. We don’t have time. Please do only back projects you fundamentally understand.
Take control of your digital identities and educate yourselves on what’s going on. Totalitarianism is a thread more than ever. It does not come as a violent suppressive military regime but rather as a subtle, invisible force using data, patterns, and targeting for their AI manipulation. These powers are organized globally.

# The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto

Timothy C. May

A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!
