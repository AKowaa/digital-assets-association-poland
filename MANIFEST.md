# Manifest

Everybody „investing“ into digital assets should read: 
1) brave new world 

2) 1984 

3) a cypherpunk manifesto 

4) open source everything manifesto 

5) no place to hide and watch the documentaries 

6) the internets own boy 

7) deep web to get at least a tiny little clue of what this is all about.

Our societies are at a tipping point. Mind Manipulation and global scale surveillance are omnipresent. Only some few people seem to care. For the first time in history we have access to the weapons allowing for digital self defense in the form of privacy preserving communication (matrix, protonmail, later orchid protocol), transactions (zcash, monero) and business flows (ethereum with snarks, keep.network) - let’s use them.

Crypto might be our only way out of this misery, so let’s not screw this up. The bigger the speculative bubble, the bigger the crash, the longer a potential „crypto winter“. We don’t have time. Please do only back projects you fundamentally understand.
Take control of your digital identities and educate yourselves on what’s going on. Totalitarianism is a thread more than ever. It does not come as a violent suppressive military regime but rather as a subtle, invisible force using data, patterns, and targeting for their AI manipulation. These powers are organized globally.
