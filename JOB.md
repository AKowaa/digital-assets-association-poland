Hello together üëãüèª,

My name is Valerio and I am the Founder of House of Solidity.

At House of Solidity we are dedicated to help Developers from all backgrounds get exposure and gain experience in blockchain.

We mainly address people with already some experience in solidity but also help non-solidity Devs which are interested in gaining experience and skills by the best approach of all:
Learning by Doing ;)

We have access to a variety of projects and companies in many different domains (DeFi, NFT, Web3.0, building Dapps, IoT, Custody, Supply-Chain, Corporate blockchain projects, ...).

Therefore we will find for you paid jobs at interesting and fitting blockchain projects, which allow you to grow and not just want already perfect Senior Devs.

Our service is free for you :)
